    "## Robust Facility Location Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will consider the problem of robust facility location, based on some (uncertain) projections about demand. \n",
    "Let's consider the following, where we plan to pick a subset of 10 facility locations with indices $i \\in I$ to service 50 customers with indices $j \\in J$. \n",
    "Each facility has a capacity $s_i$, and a construction cost of $f_i$. \n",
    "The transportation costs $c_{i,j}$ are defined across each facility-customer pair $\\{i, j\\}$, and are variable depending on the quantity of goods moved. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by launching a Julia environment, adding some packages and plotting utilities, and generating some random (but interesting) data. "
